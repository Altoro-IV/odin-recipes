        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>A deliciously seasoned salmon that's easy to make on those busy weeknights after work.</p>

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 Tbsp. neutral oil</li>
                <li>(6-oz) skin-on-salmon fillets</li>
                <li>Kosher salt</li>
                <li>1 lemon</li>
                <li>4 Tbsp. unsalted butter, cubed</li>
                <li>1 large clove garlic, finely chopped</li>
                <li>1 Tbsp. chopped fresh parsley or dill</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large stainless steel skillet over medium heat, heat oil until shimmering. Pat salmon dry; season both sides with a heavy pinch of salt.</li>
                <li>Place salmon in skillet skin side down and cook, undisturbed, 4 minutes. Flip salmon, then finely grate lemon zest around salmon. 
                    Dot butter pieces around salmon, swirling pan to help melt butter and distribute zest. Cook 2 minutes.</li>
                <li>Cut zested lemon in half. Add garlic and juice from 1/2 lemon around salmon and cook, undisturbed, until salmon easily flakes with a fork
                     and garlic is fragrant and slightly softened, about 1 minute more.</li>
                <li>Transfer salmon to a platter. Top with parsley.</li>
            </ol>
